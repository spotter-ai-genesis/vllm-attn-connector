"""Unit checks for the per-position head reduction, no GPU or vLLM needed.

The connector reduces each decode step's [L, H, T] attention to two [T] vectors
plus a winner id, accumulating layer by layer so the full tensor is never
materialised. These tests replicate that streaming reduction and compare it
against the obvious dense computation.

Also pins the two facts that decided the emitted schema:

  * a max over the top K heads equals the max over all heads identically, so
    such a column could never carry information;
  * a mean over the top K heads *is* distinct from both emitted aggregations --
    it is a real statistic that was left out on cost grounds, not because it is
    redundant. The test keeps that distinction checkable.
